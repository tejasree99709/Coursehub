COURSEHUB
           -A centralised platform for student-faculty course management system.
In today‚Äôs world, certification courses are very important for learning new skills and growing in careers. However, managing these courses and keeping track of certifications can be challenging. Students often face difficulties in organizing their progress, and administrators struggle with handling multiple tasks.
Our project solves this problem by building a simple and user-friendly web platform. This platform helps administrators easily create and manage courses, while students can track their progress, access course materials, and get their certifications all in one place.
This system saves time, reduces confusion, and provides a smooth experience for everyone. It makes the process easier, faster, and more efficient, helping both students and administrators.
